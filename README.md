Higher Education Cybersecurity Implementation Framework (HECIF)
Higher education providers face a unique set of challenges that make securing their information technology infrastructure and data a complex task. The goal of HECIF is to create a community of professional practice within higher education to design, develop, implement, monitor and govern cybersecurity programs to meet the most significant risks, and - most importantly - identify solutions, or categories of solutions, that can reduce cyber risk.
